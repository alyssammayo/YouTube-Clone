# YouTube-Clone
This is a YouTube Clone that features clickable videos and channels and uses Responsive Web Design

I followed the HTML & CSS Full Course Beginner to Pro course video by SuperSimpleDev on YouTube.
The course was one video that was 6 hours 31 minutes and 23 seconds long. There were 17 chapters.

After I completed the course, I added some more videos and swaped out the ones from the tutorials. I completed his challenge of adding links to the videos and the channels.
I also added my own picture as the my channel picture. I made that picture in Canva.
